## The Project

#### **What is it?** 
 The project is an eventual app called BerkasBerkah which is a solution for people in Bandung to mitigate waste. By using this app they can sell or give their second use item away!

#### **How does it work?** 
Users would scan their second hand items so that our Artificial Intelligence could do its magic and see is your item fit for the website or not!
